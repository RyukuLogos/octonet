 Just Released: "Octonet" – A Distributed AI Architecture Inspired by Octopuses
"How do you stop AI from forgetting? Ask an octopus."
Octopuses distribute two-thirds of their neurons across eight arms, with each arm capable of independent thinking. Inspired by this "distributed intelligence," I've released a paper on a radically new neural architecture called "Octonet."
🧠 What Makes It Revolutionary?
Traditional AI is a monolithic giant brain. When it learns something new, old knowledge gets overwritten—the infamous "catastrophic forgetting" problem.
Octonet is different:

A central "Head" handles strategy
Countless "Tentacles" permanently store individual knowledge
Learning signals split into "Announcement" and "Result" for complete update control

In other words, when you learn new knowledge, old knowledge is physically protected. Mathematically zero catastrophic forgetting.
💾 The Scaling Magic
Here's the kicker: knowledge can be stored on SSDs. Load into memory only when needed.
Know what this means? Freedom from VRAM constraints.
Potentially 100x the knowledge of GPT-4 on the same hardware. Seriously.
🎯 Who Should Read This

ML researchers in despair over catastrophic forgetting
Anyone building lifelong learning AI
People wondering "why octopus and not brain?"
Weirdos tired of existing architectures
